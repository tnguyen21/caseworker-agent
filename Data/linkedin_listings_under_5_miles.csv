For more information, visit reedsmith.com.

 Position Summary 

The preferred offices for this position are New York, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Chicago and Philadelphia

Reed Smith is seeking a Senior Manager, Head of Strategic Insights to play a critical role in translating complex data analysis into meaningful and actionable insights for our firm's leadership. This role is not about dashboarding – we already have a significant data collection, a broad team of analysts, and plenty of great dashboards. This position will act as a trusted advisor to senior leadership, guiding and empowering them to understand, interpret, and act upon key insights from our data collection to enhance firm performance, drive growth, and deliver superior client outcomes. The role is as broad as the range of insights, which include identifying special intelligence across client, financial, pipeline, market, risk, competitive, pricing, talent, and other aspects of tuning a global legal practice.

The role must also bridge between leadership and our Intelligence and AI analysts. To curate the most impactful insights, these technical and data teams must be assembling, growing, enhancing, and correlating our data with these outcomes in mind.

Reporting to the Director of Intelligence, the Senior Manager, Head of Strategic Insights will play a pivotal role in shaping the firm's future by championing a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.

Context For Strategic Insights

Reed Smith has committed to an extended program of re-examining how it approaches traditional business operations and the provision of legal services. The firm is creating a common global platform that provides its lawyers and clients with a competitive edge, in terms of intelligence, learning, collaboration, efficiencies, and risk management. The firm has completed an initial foundational phase which included the provision of 22 new or improved business systems, the expansion of the firm’s data framework to over 8 billion elements, and ongoing piloting of key Generative AI systems. The firm invested in a data analytics COE, expanded programs in Client Value and Strategic Resourcing, and recently hired a Director of Applied AI.

But these elements are means to an end. To prepare to evolve the DNA of the firm, the firm created the Innovation Lab in 2022 headed by a PhD Anthropologist, utilizing human centered design and client feedback in creating fresh playbooks. In alignment with senior partners, the firm identified four key practices to serve as long term proofs of concepts for these collective changes as well as fresh considerations of incentives, mentoring, and value. Our objectives aren’t simply to use tech better, but to grow our pipelines, understand and predict our clients’ needs more deeply, be leaders in collaboration despite our global footprint, and optimize our efficiency along the way. As we prove and tune our results through key practices, we will grow to impact more of the firm overall.

Thus, insights from our data have become critical to our work. Our expectations for what our leaders should understand are as broad as the ever-expanding volumes of data available to them. We have to cut through the noise, predict the future, and keep attention on the most important issues.

Team

Reporting to this role is a small although experienced team of business and data insight analysts. This role is a senior member of our Intelligence team, which also currently includes team members focused on CRM administration, data quality, data analysis, and reporting. As beneficial, we also contract skills with particular areas of expertise, notably vendors to develop data science solutions and to implement vendor-created software systems. There are also complementary resources around the firm including our Innovation Lab, Applied AI, Change Leadership, Learning & Development, IT Transformation, and the Innovation and Strategy Committee.

Essential Functions 

 With Intelligence teams: Gain a thorough understanding of existing analyses across all areas of the firm, including financial, client, talent, and competitive intelligence.  Seek to understand what existing analysis should mean to leadership and what stories it does not yet reveal.  Ensure the Insights team becomes experts in sources of intelligence, whether structured or unstructured, internal or external, established or emerging, explicit or tacit.  Guide the roadmap of data acquisition and data quality work based on the stories that need to be learned and told.  Guide the analyst and technical roles on the Intelligence teams on how to tune analysis, perform new investigations, seek patterns, improve depth, identify new sources of data, or otherwise push further into learning from our data assets.  Evaluate, challenge, tune, and lead user testing of new areas of analysis and insights to continuously improve depth, usefulness, and uniqueness.  Stay informed about emerging trends, best practices, and advancements in data analytics and strategic planning, and recommend innovative approaches to enhance the firm's data capabilities and competitive advantage.  With firm leadership: Collaborate closely with firm leadership to identify key business questions and objectives that can be addressed through data analysis and insights.  Partner with practice group leaders, department heads, and other stakeholders to assess data needs, define performance metrics, and develop actionable insights tailored to specific business areas.  Support the development and implementation of a strategic framework for leveraging data to inform decision-making and drive operational excellence across the firm.  Design and deliver presentations and reports that communicate data-driven insights in a clear, concise, and compelling manner to facilitate understanding and decision-making at all levels of the organization.  Serve as a subject matter expert on data-related topics, providing training, coaching, and resources to equip leadership with the knowledge and skills needed to effectively leverage data in their roles.

Director of Firearm Suicide Prevention Policy, Stoneleigh Fellowship
CeaseFirePA, Pennsylvania’s leading state-based gun violence prevention advocacy organization, is hiring an inaugural Director of Firearm Suicide Prevention Policy to build a comprehensive approach to Pennsylvania’s firearm suicide crisis through a policy, messaging, and coalition strategy. The Director will be a part of the Stoneleigh Foundation Fellowship Program, exceptional leaders who work within and alongside systems to catalyze change.
More on CeaseFirePA and the issue:CeaseFirePA envisions a world where people in every community across the Commonwealth feel safe from gun violence because they are safe. Tragically, gun violence takes the lives of nearly 1,900 Pennsylvanians every year, and many are stunned to learn that more than half of gun fatalities in Pennsylvania are suicides. Rural communities, in particular, lose loved ones to suicide on an alarming level, with the Poconos and Southwest Pennsylvania coal country experiencing gun death rates that rival major cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. The high rate of firearm suicide is rarely mentioned on the news or in conversations, which leads to a misconception in the public that mass shootings and community violence are the largest sources of gun deaths. Firearm suicides must be a major part of the conversation around gun violence prevention solutions.
CeaseFirePA is working to address this misconception and build a comprehensive program to address this crisis, and the Director will be leading the charge. Over our two decades of work we have expanded background checks, disarmed abusers, won $180 million for community-based violence prevention programs, and launched powerful coalitions standing against gun violence. We have become Pennsylvania's leading organization working to end this public health crisis as we fight illegal trafficking, boost funding for safer communities, and save the next life from suicide.

This will involve reaching out to, building relationships with, and engaging potential allies in rural and suburban communities, especially including veterans, suicide experts, hunters, law enforcement, faith leaders, and doctors.Tell powerful stories of how suicide is impacting rural communities through CeaseFirePA's ""Deadly By Design"" project to start to shift rural communities’ understanding of gun violence, its connection to gun high ownership rates, and the need for action.Working with our communications team, develop a messaging framework to ensure we are effectively and consistently increasing the publics understanding of firearm suicide and potential solutions across all of CeaseFirePA’s work.Discussing the crisis with media, partners, and key communities to enhance local recognition of this crisis and elevate discussion of it.Collaborate with a team of organizers and advocates to help as they work with public health, veteran, law enforcement, and faith partners in their communities and programs;As we move toward lobbying on policy positions, working with allies and victims, present narratives and testimony to decision-makers.

Court Appointed Special Advocates of Philadelphia,Volunteer: CASA Volunteers for Children in Foster Care- Apply Now!,"Every year more than half a million abused and neglected children are in need of safe, permanent, nurturing homes. That's where CASA steps in. CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) was created in 1977 to make sure the abuse and neglect these children originally suffered at home doesn't continue as abuse and neglect at the hands of the system. As trained advocates, CASA volunteers are appointed by judges to be a voice for these children in court. The result is that a child is placed into a safe, loving home where he/she can thrive. It is the CASA vision to provide a volunteer for each and every abused and neglected child who needs one.

Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) trains members of the community to advocate in court for children in the foster care system. Children who are in foster care and are going through family court often don't have a voice. A CASA volunteer is someone who can give that child a voice. Someone who forms a direct relationship with the child. Someone who will visit that child in their home every month. Someone who will make sure their needs are addressed by making best interest recommendations to the judge presiding over the case. CASA volunteers commit to 10-15 hours a month for 2 years (the average time to close a case) You don't need any previous special training. We will train you. You just need to care about our most vulnerable citizens. Find out more and register for an information session on our website www.casaphiladelphia.org/volunteer/.

CASA is currently accepting applications! Training are offered 4 times a year - January, April, July and October. Training classes meet once a week in person and once a week on virtually for the month. Once an advocate work is both virtual/online and in person. We hope you can be the one caring adult that a child in foster care is waiting for! Apply today!
